# csgo_run
This is a JA bot for a roulette website cs:go https://csgorun.ru/

The bot was written at 25.07.2020. It worked in that time and now it should be updated.
The main idea is looking for a certain sequence and make a bet. To find a most likely sequence you sgould see py folder.

Scripts in py folder do the following things:
1. Parse last results by Requests
2. Analyse the data by math functiouns and take more frequent results with "victorys"
3. Make a new JS script to work with it.
